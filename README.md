## **Cache Bank Portfolio Profile**

### Overview
i Learned alot about tailwind classes .It was a bit overwhelming working with tailwind and both using css in html.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery
- **Responsive Design**: My website is very responsive but so far i'm good with tailwind and very comfortable using it for different screen size.
- **Styling Elements**: I'm very comfident in using tailwind elements at this point to style my site, it's very unique.

#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: I had a little bit of a hard time when trying to make my web responsive for smaller screen. 
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: Using tailwind hover elements was very comfusing a little because sometimes it would'nt hover but i figured out the mistakes.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: I need to work on responsive designs, hovers, focus, and other css properties because my codes sometimes dont work and its hard to find errors.
- **Code Optimization**:  following the steps made me understand what was needed and i had to figure out on my own.
- **Creative Design Choices**: i think i need to work on more layouts to understand where to apply some of the css propertie with tailwind components.

#### Overall Learning Experience

This Project helped me to familiarize myself with a framework like tailwind .It is very useful made my work very easy .It was very productive to follow along and also figure out some of the problems on my own for my code to work correctly.
